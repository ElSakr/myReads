# MyReads App: Udacity's project

The project's purpose is to build a book tracking application using ReactJS, passing controlled components and passing data between components.

## Installation

You can clone this repository or download it as a .zip file. Once downloaded, you need to run `npm install` and then `npm start` in your console.

## App Functionality

In this application, the Home page displays a list of "shelves", each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Each book has a control that lets the user select the shelf for that book. When the user selects a different shelf, the book moves there.

The search page has a text input field that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets the user add the book to their library

## Dependencies

I've used the following resources in order to complete the project:

[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/): The whole project is based on React

[Prop Types](https://reactjs.org/): Runtime type checking for React props and similar objects.

[Ant design ](https://ant.design/): as a UI library
